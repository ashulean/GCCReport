**Talent Pool Availability: Assessing the Depth and Quality of the Tech Talent Pool in Prospective Countries**

When considering the establishment or expansion of a Global Capability Center (GCC), the depth, breadth, and quality of a country’s talent pool in technology-related fields is a critical factor. This includes the volume of skilled professionals, their educational backgrounds, language proficiencies, and the availability of specialized expertise in emerging disciplines. This chapter presents data on the availability and quality of tech talent in India, the Philippines, Poland, Mexico, and Brazil, citing authoritative sources wherever possible.

**1. Overview of Talent Supply**

Tech talent pools are often measured by the number of graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, the size of the existing tech workforce, and the presence of educational institutions focusing on computing and engineering disciplines.

- **India:**  
  India produces one of the world’s largest cohorts of STEM graduates annually. According to the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE 2021-2022), over 2.3 million students graduate with STEM degrees each year. The National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) estimated India’s IT workforce at approximately 5 million professionals by late 2022, encompassing software developers, data analysts, IT support, and other roles. India’s large population and broad university network, including premier institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), create a voluminous pipeline of fresh engineers and technologists.

- **The Philippines:**  
  The Philippines, while smaller in population than India, still graduates a significant number of IT and engineering students annually. According to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Statistical Reports for 2021-2022, the Philippines produced around 100,000–120,000 IT and engineering graduates each year. While this is lower than India, the Philippines has cultivated a strong foundation of technology professionals working in IT-Business Process Management (IT-BPM) roles. The Information Technology and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) reported that the IT-BPM sector employed around 1.55 million individuals in 2022, of which a growing portion specialized in higher-value IT and software development segments.
