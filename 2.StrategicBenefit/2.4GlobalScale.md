**Global Reach and Scalability: Expanding Market Reach with the Ability to Scale Quickly**

**1. Geographic Positioning and Time Zone Advantages**

Global coverage often depends on aligning with key markets and time zones to enhance responsiveness and streamline communications.

- **India:**  
  India’s time zone (IST, UTC+5:30) offers partial overlap with Europe and a “follow-the-sun” model for North America. Many multinational companies leverage India’s workforce for round-the-clock operations, enabling project handovers between teams across time zones. This geographical advantage supports global delivery models, particularly in IT services and technical support.
