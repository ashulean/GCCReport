**Cost Efficiency: Comparing Labor and Operational Costs Across Target Countries**

In establishing a Global Capability Center (GCC), comparing cost structures across different offshore locations is a fundamental step. Costs extend beyond base wages to include employee benefits, office space rentals, infrastructure, regulatory compliance, taxation, and other operational overheads. This chapter presents factual cost-related data from selected countries—India, the Philippines, Poland, Mexico, and Brazil—based on publicly available reports, government data, and recognized industry benchmarking sources. All data, where possible, reflects information published or accessed between 2022 and 2023.
